<p>My name is Haonan(Alex) Jing. I was born in mainland China and moved to Singapore for my high school when I was 14. Currently, I am a undergraduate studying computer science at UC Berkeley.</p>

<p>I entered Cal as a chemistry major but I found my passion in computer science after taking cs61a with Prof. John DeNero. In complete honesty the transition was a real struggle, but I am so glad that there were so many people and resources out there to help me.</p>

<p>I enjoy teaching CS because I understand how hard it can be for someone who has never coded in their life and it makes me really happy if I can help make coding less daunting to them, just like how others helped me.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I enjoyed cooking and running. I will be running SF half marathon in the end of July.</p>

<p>--update-- I finished the SF marathon, here's a picture of me at the finish line.</p>
